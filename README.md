# Network-Meta-Analysis-Bayesian-Inference-Multivariate-Random-Effects
## About
Computer code for the Bayesian computation in the paper Li et al. (2018) was written for the FORTRAN 95 compiler. This R package is built as a platform to call in the FORTRAN code.

## Makefile usage
- `make`: the default target for building and checking the package as necessary,
  which is equivalent to `make check`.
- `make build`: build the package if needed.
- `make install`: install the package to local R library.
- `make clean`: clean all the temporary files including `*.tar.gz`.
